//! Trace bundle format, writer, and reducer for Codex rollouts.
//!
//! This crate owns the trace schema. Hot-path Codex code should depend on the
//! small writer API here; semantic replay and viewer projections stay outside
//! `codex-core`.
//!
//! See `README.md` for the system diagram and reducer model.
