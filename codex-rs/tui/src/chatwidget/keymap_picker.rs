//! `ChatWidget` integration points for the `/keymap` picker flow.
//!
//! The picker model, capture view, and edit semantics live in [`crate::keymap_setup`]. This module
//! keeps only the `ChatWidget`-owned responsibilities: opening those views in the bottom pane,
//! routing users back to the right picker row after an edit, and synchronizing the committed
//! keymap config back into the live widget state. Keeping these methods outside `chatwidget.rs`
//! keeps the main transcript/event surface from also owning the `/keymap` navigation details.
//!
//! The important invariant is that any accepted keymap edit must update three places together:
//! the stored `Config.tui_keymap`, the cached copy-response binding used by app-level shortcuts,
//! and the bottom pane's runtime keymap bindings. Updating only one of those would make the UI
//! appear to accept a remap while some handlers still respond to the old keys.
